# Setting Up External Configuration in NestJS with Mongoose

This guide will walk you through setting up an external configuration service in NestJS and integrating it with Mongoose.

## Step 1: Install Necessary Packages

Install the required packages for configuration management and MongoDB integration.

```bash
npm install @nestjs/config @nestjs/axios axios @nestjs/mongoose mongoose
```
````

## Step 2: Create Configuration Module

Generate a new module named `configurations` to manage the application's configuration.

```bash
nest g mo configurations
```

## Step 3: Create Configuration Service

Generate a new service within the `configurations` module. This service will handle fetching the configuration from an external source.

```bash
nest g s configurations
```

## Step 4: Implement Configuration Service

In this step, you will implement the service created in Step 3. This service will be responsible for making HTTP requests to an external service to fetch the configuration settings.

## Step 5: Integrate with Configuration Module

Update the `configurations` module to use the `@nestjs/config` and `@nestjs/axios` modules. This will allow the module to load configurations asynchronously from the external service and make HTTP requests.

## Step 6: Integrate with App Module

Finally, update your main `AppModule` to include the `configurations` module and use the fetched configuration for setting up Mongoose. This ensures that your MongoDB connection settings are dynamically loaded from the external configuration service.

By following these steps, you can manage your NestJS application's configuration more flexibly, allowing for easy updates and centralized configuration management.
